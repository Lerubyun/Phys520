1) A) There seems to be multiple ways to undo an error at several timepoints: discard changes, undo commit, revert changes in commit, or creating a new branch from an older commit. B) I like the merging function and how it overrides older versions with more recently added lines.
2) This is not a bad thing, but because there are a lot of functions and a lot of moving parts, GitHub/GitHub desktop does not seem intuitive to me and seems like a steep learning curve.
3) A) Is there a difference between "push" and "publish"? B) For the assignment, are we supposed to make a pull request from "main-2023" to "main"? Why can't we make pull requests to the same branch (if I make changes within a branch on my computer, why can't I share these changes to the same branch that is remote and shared with others)? C) How are all the pushed files organized in the remote repository (especially when there are tens of people working on a project)? Are they easy to parse through/does an administrator need to keep up with the remote work space to keep it tidy?
