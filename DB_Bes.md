1) A) There seems to be multiple ways to undo an error at several timepoints: discard changes, undo commit, revert changes in commit, or creating a new branch from an older commit. B) I like the merging function and how it overrides older versions with more recently added lines.
2) This is not a bad thing, but because there are a lot of functions and a lot of moving parts, GitHub/GitHub desktop does not seem intuitive to me.
3) What is the difference between "push" and "publish"?
