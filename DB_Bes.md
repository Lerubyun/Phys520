1) A) There seems to be multiple ways to undo an error at several timepoints: discard changes, undo commit, revert changes in commit, or creating a new branch from an older commit. B) I like the merging function and how it overrides older versions with more recently added lines.
2) This is not a bad thing, but because there are a lot of functions and a lot of moving parts, GitHub/GitHub desktop does not seem intuitive to me and seems like a steep learning curve.
3) A) Is there a difference between "push" and "publish"? B) How are all the pushed files organized in the remote repository (especially when there are tens of people working on a project)? Are they easy to parse through/does an administrator need to keep up with the remote work space to keep it tidy? C) I am confused about the pull requests. Are we supposed to issue a pull request from main-2023 with our username to main-2023 that is within the Beardslab profile?
