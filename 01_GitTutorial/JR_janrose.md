Takehome message: **Use git**

## Assignment
Clone https://github.com/beards-lab/Phys520

- Create a initials_your-nick-name.md into the 01_GitTutorial folder
  - E.g. FJ_jez.md
- Write down what you 
  1. like about GitHub
  2. dislike about GitHub
  3. At least one question
- Commit, push, and issue a pull request

1. I enjoy the convenience of keeping track of various versions of code I'll be utilizing in Github. I also enjoy the general ease of use provided by Github desktop so I don't have to fumble around with terminal commands and have a way of visualizing the commands I'm doing.

2. I dislike the fact that it's not very intuitive or new user friendly. It's quite difficult to know how to properly maneuver through the branches, setting main branches, the way committing works vs pushing, etc. If we didn't have a tutorial I wouldn't know how to use it. 

3. If someone modifies code/ a file on Github proper. Do the changes it still have to go through the same committal barriers as they would when committing from a local repository?
