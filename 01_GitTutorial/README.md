- Write down what you

  2. dislike about GitHub
  2. At least one question
- Commit, push, and issue a pull request

## Answers to your questions

### Interfacing
> A question I have is how Git interfaces with editors like VS Code

> I don't like how GitHub has several places to be used. I have only used the web interface before and am only used to using it. 

> When I try to create a new text file in a repository, for example a README.md file, the file is still showing as README.md.txt. What can I do differently to get rid of the .txt on those files? 

### Security
> It is my understanding that GitHub is not the best tool to use for secure/private data. What other options are available for collaborating and sharing code if working on project with more sensitive data?

Good thinking. You can keep the repository private or private within the team. For added security of really sensitive data, you can use your own git servers or dedicated hosting or gitlab.

> How does GitHub maintain an accurate copy of a file if multiple people are editing it at the same time?





> How to avoid merge conflict while working on Git

> To what extent will people actually utilize GitHub? (It needs to create a repository first, add a new file, write in the file and then have to commit and push.)

> Does any new repository need a new empty folder? Can I save all the repositories under a collection folder?

> What if when you push the newly edited file and found there is an updated one after your pull request?

> If someone modifies code/ a file on Github proper. Do the changes it still have to go through the same committal barriers as they would when committing from a local repository?

> Do we have final presentations about our projects?

> Is there a difference between "push" and "publish"? B) How are all the pushed files organized in the remote repository (especially when there are tens of people working on a project)? Are they easy to parse through/does an administrator need to keep up with the remote work space to keep it tidy? C) I am confused about the pull requests. Are we supposed to issue a pull request from main-2023 with our username to main-2023 that is within the Beardslab profile? 

> Are we going to be turning in assignments over git all sememster? 

> If a version of your code/document becomes obsolete would it be recommended to get rid of it to clear up some of the version history or would this cause problems along the line as we discussed in class the other day about getting rid of things? It seems eventually with enough edits/commits things would start to get cluttered so how would you maintain clean organization?

> Is Git really used anywhere outside of coding? I've heard several people mention that it can be used for anything, not just code. Yet I never hear about anybody actually using it for things other than code.

> This has nothing to do with what we covered in class, but I know GitHub just came out with GitHub Copilot -- and AI coding assistant. Have any of the instructors tried this out? It seems really freaking cool.   

> Using git on the command line should be a punishhment for murderers. 

> Does github deskptop have more functionality compared to just using terminal, or are there the same terminal commands that do actions done in github desktop?

> I wish there was an easier way to visualize branches and changes

> How would I have created this file in my desktop.. I had troubles finding the folder on my desktop but I can see it fine on the GitHub web interface.
