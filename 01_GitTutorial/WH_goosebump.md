1. I read somewhere, "Once you commit something, you can always retrieve it". That degree of security is a huge plus for GitHub.

2. I takes a lot of getting used to. GitHub Desktop helps out massively. Using git on the command line should be a punishhment for murderers. 

3a. Is Git really used anywhere outside of coding? I've heard several people mention that it can be used for anything, not just code. Yet I never hear about anybody actually using it for things other than code.

3b. This has nothing to do with what we covered in class, but I know GitHub just came out with GitHub Copilot -- and AI coding assistant. Have any of the instructors tried this out? It seems really freaking cool.
