1ï¼‰I really like the idea of version control. It will be really helpful if i want to reverse some changes.
2) I don't really have any opnions against Github yet. 
3) For this class we are only manipulating a few lines of words and we made like 8 commits. I assume that if I use github in the future for coding for which I will need to make thousands of commits and tons of versions. Do you have any suggestions on how to stay clear-minded and not feel overwhelmed by numerous commits and versions?
I still don't get why should we use the github web to edit our codes but only the readme file.

Bonus:"Secret message: Extra credit for using Git throughout the course!"
