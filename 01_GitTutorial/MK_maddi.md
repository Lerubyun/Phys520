1. I like that github makes version control easy and organized. 
As someone who codes a lot and makes schematic files this would have been super useful for classes in the past where I had to 
do homeworks that built off of previous homeworks codes. It also allows you to revert when you mess something up which is great. 

2. What I dislike about github is that it has some terminology and practices that may serve as a barrier to entry for others to use.
For example I think my family who are outside the stem field would not understand some of the terms and concepts as easily and refuse
to use it despite how useful it could be for their own work with text documents and spreadsheets.

3. If a version of your code/document becomes obsolete would it be recommended to get rid of it to clear up some of the version history
or would this cause problems along the line as we discussed in class the other day about getting rid of things? It seems eventually with
enough edits/commits things would start to get cluttered so how would you maintain clean organization?

Bonus: The hidden message says that there is extra credit for using git throughout the course.
