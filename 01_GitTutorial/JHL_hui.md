Write down what you 
  1. like about GitHub
      GitHub can help track all the revisions and changes. Therefore, I can only keep one version of my file and can go back to any checkpoint of my file and edit it again.
      For the same project or file, you can create different branches. Sometimes, I have a hard time making choices. Branches can help me keep all my choices for the same project and also can merge different versions of your file. It will also check the conlficts to avoid your project getting messed up.
      GitHub is also a good tool for collaborative work. You can make changes through pull and push and edit the file locally. Then you can know the most updated progress and also avoid the risk of poor internet.
      Tags, network
  2. dislike about GitHub
      Since GitHub has local and remote repositories, we need to switch frequently between the internet and the desktop. This may cause some mistakes. It may be better to embed the internet part into the desktop stage.
      It needs time to get familiar with it. 
      
  3. At least one question
      To what extent will people actually utilize GitHub? (It needs to create a repository first, add a new file, write in the file and then have to commit and push.)
      Does any new repository need a new empty folder? Can I save all the repositories under a collection folder?
      What if when you push the newly edited file and found there is an updated one after your pull request?
